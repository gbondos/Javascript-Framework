This application is a simple ember.js app.
I am following a youtube tutorial from Traversy media and creating a similar app.
It is my first time exploring or building an app with ember.js.


STEP 1: Install and download Node JS if you already don't have it install - https://nodejs.org/en/
STEP 2: For the database of this project, we will be using Firebase -
 Firebase is a Realtime Database A Cloud Hosted NoSQL Database To Store & Sync Your Mobile App Data.
 Signup with your google account and click get started, then add project.

STEP 4: Install Ember Inspector, actually it is a plugin that could be added on Google Chrome

############### INSTALLING EMBER FRAMEWORK ########################
Install Ember
STEP 1: Go to command prompt or command line - run this command # npm install -g ember-cli
Create a New Application
Once you've installed Ember CLI via npm, you will have access to a new ember command in your terminal. You can use the ember new command to create a new application.

CODE:  ember new ember-quickstart

Make sure everything is working properly. cd into the application directory ember-quickstart and start the development server by typing:

cd ember-quickstart
ember serve

STEP 2:
start by editing the application template. This template is always on screen while the user has your application loaded. In your editor, open app/templates/application.hbs and change it to the following:

app/templates/application.hbs
<h1>PeopleTracker</h1>

{{outlet}}

STEP 3:
Define a Route
you can think of routes as being the different pages that make up your application.
To generate a route, type this in a new terminal window in your ember-quickstart directory:
ember generate route scientists


STEP 4:
Create a UI Component
 create a people-list component that we can use in multiple places to show a list of people.

As usual, there's a generator that makes this easy for us. Make a new component by typing:

ember generate component people-list
